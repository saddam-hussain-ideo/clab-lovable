# Token Distribution Module Analysis

## Overview
The Token Distribution module allows administrators to distribute tokens to users who have completed purchases in the presale. The main component is `TokenDistributionAdmin.tsx`, which handles token validation, distribution queue management, and the token distribution process.

## Current Functionality
1. **Token Validation**: Administrators validate token mint ownership and check balances
2. **Queue Management**: Select confirmed purchases that need tokens distributed
3. **Distribution Process**: Batch process distributions to selected wallet addresses

## Error Analysis
The current TypeScript error is in `TokenDistributionAdmin.tsx` at line 351:
```
error TS2322: Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'Promise<void>'
```

This error occurs because the function `markPurchaseAsDistributed` is being awaited but is not properly defined as an async function, causing a type mismatch between the expected Promise return type and the actual void return type.

### Problem Details:
1. The `markPurchaseAsDistributed` function is declared to return a `Promise<boolean>` 
2. Inside the `distributeTokens` function, this function is awaited: `await markPurchaseAsDistributed(recipient.id)`
3. However, the function is not declared with the `async` keyword
4. This causes TypeScript to infer a return type of `void` instead of `Promise<boolean>`

## Solution Plan
1. Add the `async` keyword to the `markPurchaseAsDistributed` function declaration
2. Ensure the function explicitly returns a Promise with boolean value in all code paths
3. This will align the declared return type with the actual implementation

## Implementation Steps
1. Locate the `markPurchaseAsDistributed` function in `TokenDistributionAdmin.tsx`
2. Add the `async` keyword to the function declaration
3. Verify that all code paths correctly return boolean values (true/false)
4. Test the token distribution functionality to ensure it works correctly

## Benefits
1. Resolves the TypeScript error
2. Improves code reliability by ensuring proper Promise handling
3. Maintains the existing functionality without introducing new bugs
